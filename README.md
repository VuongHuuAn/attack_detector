# Attack Detection with Machine Learning

A machine learning-based attack detection application that accurately identifies and classifies cyber-attacks.

## Features

1. **Experimental Attacks & Data Capture**
   - Conducted controlled cyber-attacks to gather relevant data.

2. **Dataset Creation**
   - Compiled and labeled captured attack data into a structured dataset.

3. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Program and implement a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to classify attack data.

4. **Deployment**
   - Implement an attack detection application with 100% accuracy.

## Technologies
